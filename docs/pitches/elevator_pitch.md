# Great Wall elevator pitch

In order to fulfill the promise of allowing commoners to _"be their own banks"_, Bitcoin infrastructure has to enable even **low-tech individuals** provide themselves bank levels of security in the broad sense, which include **physical security**.

The (still) relatively early stage of Bitcoinization of global economy provides early-adopters the benefit of [obscurity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_through_obscurity). Long-term solutions to be adopted by the masses are, however, by definition transparent.

By logic, therefore, the **centuries old, ubiquitously accepted [doctrine of non-obscurity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerckhoffs%27s_principle) will prevale** and non-obscure security measures eventually **will be the norm**. Great Wall is the first such non-obscure protocol for coercion-resistance in self-custody. It happens to be **monetizable** through the employment of cutting-edge cryptographic techniques like [Fully Homomorphic Encryption](https://www.ibm.com/topics/homomorphic-encryption).

As of the time of writing, we already have the public, formal backing of the protocol by respected names of Bitcoin community and ongoing communication with potential investors.
