## About
Protocol and application for providing Kerckhoffian, 0-trust, deviceless coercion-resistance in self-custody. To understand the protocol, refer to the [white paper and executive summary.](./white_paper_executive_summary/white_paper_executive_summary.md)


<!-- Reproducing Demo 1 Experiment -->
## Demo
The following steps will allow an easy memorization of the path demonstrated in [demo 1](https://drive.proton.me/urls/GQZDRPBKE8#33ZVNJBXKAMd) within as little as 1-2 hours:
1. Download, install, and learn how to use [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) in your system;
2. Download (or clone from repository) and import [demo 1 Anki deck](demos/GW_procedural_memory_1.apkg);
3. Study deck;
4. Download (or clone from repository) [directory src](./src) **specifically in version** `e8b1551c08a3d59ee8cf30f2b5dfa803556a00a6`
5. In your system's terminal, open the directory, activate venv and then run main.py;
6. Enter `viboniboasmofiasbrchsprorirerugugucavehistmiinciwibowifltuor` as the required input `SA0`
7. You have, now, started to navigate the same tree as demonstrated in demo 1 from it's root. Continue as practiced with the aforementioned Anki deck until the leave.
8. By confirming with input 1 to the correct leave, you should get the following output: `53ffb290aa668cd5050e94aeecbb7046ce349d8ff775e409fcba45f6164a22d00e8cfb91e6836da62e7f7362cca30539b7f57f55e5c4a1cdf27a86997b99b2c6ee7760838ac0454e3e2f87714d303550b49063ff89934ecdb48e6c328f1c4561a9b7374232cdd8a71077653ca8091fc2b43b89f615ddac37aedfacd28bb605ba`. This is an **improper** BIP39 seed, _ie_ a seed that should **not** be used because it's trivially obtainable --- it or ways to obtain it have been published.
9. Just like the seed, all the addresses derived from it are **improper** and, therefore should not be used. One of them, obtained upon loading wallet with the seed in previous item, will be `bc1q3qjatkwlrxvkah0uphr2vj3lqqd73l22n7djl9`. In your favorite blockchain explorer, you can confirm that it's first two transactions were, respectively, receiving 198964 Sats, and then having them removed back (before publication). Obs.: in cases like that, it's advisable to utilize a coinjoin service to preserve privacy.


<!-- Getting Started -->
## Getting Started
This section will provide you by a quick guide to start.

### Dependencies
This project depends on the following packages:
1. argon2-cffi
2. argon2-cffi-bindings
3. cffi
4. fsrs
5. numpy
6. Pillow
7. pycparser
8. PyQt5
9. PyQt5-Qt5
10. PyQt5-sip

### Installation
> **Note:** The following steps have been tested on Ubuntu24.04 LTS.

Follow the following to get your development environment ready:
1. Install system package requirements:
```sh
sudo apt install python3-setuptools python3-virtualenv qtbase5-dev qt5-qmake cmake
```
2. Set up a python virtual environment and activate it:
```sh
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```
3. Install the requirements:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
4. Now, you can run the app using the following:

```sh
cd Great_Wall/src/
python3 -m greatwall_desktop GUI
```

### Using in Beta
Coming soon. An advanced, knowledgeable, tech-savvy reader, will, at this point, have understood what is to come and can improvise the steps by themselves. In a nutshell, all you have to do is to securely manage[^1] a brute-force resistant `SA0`, true-randomly generate a path vector of `L_i`'s, and memorize them procedurally as explained in the session above. For better effect, user can implement non-trivial **T**ime-**L**ock **P**uzzle, to impose desired time on derivation of `SA3` from `SA0`. To prevent leakage of critical content through Anki, a simple scheme with salt and pepper can be done so to avoid the need to modify Anki, but we'll leave this for a next time.

[^1]: That is, either memorize it, or deterministically derive it from other brute-force resistant secret information, or symmetrically encrypt it with a master key falling back in one of 2 previous cases and manage well the encrypted database.
